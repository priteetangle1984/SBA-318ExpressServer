----EXPRESS SERVER APPLICATION--------------
==============================================


This project is aimed at creating a server application using Node.js and Express framework. The main objectives of this project include creating a RESTful API, utilizing Express middleware, rendering views using a template engine, and interacting with a self-made API through HTML forms.

------Objectives------------------
==============================================
1. Create a RESTful API using Express
This project implements a RESTful API using Express. The API allows clients to perform CRUD operations on resources such as users, products, or any other relevant entities.

2. Create Express middleware
Express middleware functions are used to perform tasks such as logging, authentication, error handling, etc. This project demonstrates the creation and usage of Express middleware to enhance the functionality of the server.

3. Use a template engine to render views with Express
The server renders dynamic HTML views using a template engine such as EJS or Handlebars. These views may include data fetched from the server or interactions with the RESTful API.

4. Interact with a self-made API through HTML forms
HTML forms are utilized to interact with the self-made API. Users can submit data through forms, which is then processed by the server and persisted in the database via the RESTful API endpoints.
